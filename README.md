# lab-4
Submissions of your lab work must be made here.



The following lab assignment has 3 parts.
Part A: Bubble sort
Implement a bubble sort algorithm in C. The array to be sorted should be taken as an input from the user. Print the array output after every iteration (change). Also print the resulting sorted array.
 
Part B: Selection sort
Implement a selection sort algorithm in C. The array to be sorted should be taken as an input from the user. Print the array output after every iteration (change). Also print the resulting sorted array.
 
Part C: Insertion sort
Implement a insertion sort algorithm in C. The array to be sorted should be taken as an input from the user. Print the array output after every iteration (change). Also print the resulting sorted array.
Submission details :
