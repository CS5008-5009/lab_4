Lab 2
This assignment will be due on May 25th 23:59 PT.
This assignment has two parts. You need to create two .c files to implement Part A and Part B respectively, and upload them in your repo. Donâ€™t forget to attach the output screenshots in README.md.

Part A
Calculate area of shapes : rectangle, circle, square using structures and pointers.

Use structure to define different shapes. Use pointers to pass parameters to the function (call by reference). Use a switch case for the choice of shapes to call the respective functions. 

Part B
Stack:  (Implement the basic operations in a stack. These include push and pop. 
Reproduce the results of the example shown in the lab and explore edge cases. )
Implement a stack in C using arrays. The stack should have the following operations:
Push: add an element to the top of the stack
Pop: remove the element from the top of the stack
Print: Return the stack in pop sequence. 
Take the input from the user to input elements for the push function. 
You can implement a switch case with a do while loop to ask the user to choose between the above functions. 
Note: You can assume the maximum size of the stack is 7 elements.

Example output:
1. Push
2. Pop
3. Print the current stack
4. Exit
Please select: 1
Please input the integer you want to push:2
The current stack: 2
